42 Exam Solutions - TMoska
===

My solutions that I wrote for 42 exam questions either through examshell or actual exam.

Some of functions might duplicate with what's in my [libft](https://www.github.com/TMoska/libft) library, but I keep them here anyway to specifically address the exam subjects.

Exams are part of curriculum at [42 University](https://www.42.us.org).

Studying at 42?
